= Microservice Tutorials

This project contains several sub-projects that walk through various customizations and tutorial
exercises that may be common in an implementation. Please refer to each sub-module's README for more detail.

== Project Structure

.Multi-Maven Project Structure Modules Overview
|===
|Module |Description

|`ms-tutorial-base`
| Intended to be the initial project structure on which the other tutorials in this project are based

A basic project that shows running Broadleaf's unified microservices admin alongside the `Catalog`
microservice (in addition to some supporting services)

|`ms-tutorial-extension-complete`
| A completed tutorial that showcases typical extensions and customizations on top of the base project

|===

[TIP]
====
The Tutorial projects here only deploy a subset of the Broadleaf Commerce Microservices (and not the full
suite of commerce services). To evaluate the full suite of commerce
services, please visit https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/MicroservicesStarter
====

== What Do I Need?
In order to get this reference project running locally, you will want to obtain and install
the following:

=== Credentials
Access to Broadleaf's Docker Registry and Maven Nexus is needed in order to pull down the
appropriate resources.

Once you have obtained these credentials, you will need to configure them for the dependencies
below.

[NOTE]
====
Contact `info@broadleafcommerce.com` for information on how to receive these credentials
====

=== Java
You will need Java 8 or 11 installed on your machine.

* https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/[Open JDK]
* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[Oracle JDK]

=== Docker
You will need to have https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker Engine & Docker Compose] installed
locally

[TIP]
====
Docker Desktop for both Mac and Windows already includes compose along with other
docker apps.
====

Once you have docker installed, you will want to authenticate with Broadleaf's docker registry.

Type the following into your CLI:

[source,shell script]
----
docker login repository.broadleafcommerce.com:5001
----

When prompted, type in the username and password you received above.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You'll also want to configure Docker settings to use appropriate resources.
A good rule of thumb is to allow Docker to consume around 3/4 of your system resources
as necessary.

At a minimum, you will want to allocate at least 2 CPUs and 4-6 GB Memory

Ideally for a developer machine, you will want to allocate something like:
6 CPUs, 8 GB Memory, 4 GB Swap.
====

=== Maven
You'll need to have Maven installed locally as well.
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.5 or later] is recommended.

Once you have maven installed, another step you need to do before you can
build the project is to configure the authentication. Maven requires it to be specified in a
file called `settings.xml` that has to be in the `.m2` subdirectory in a user’s home directory.

1. Create a folder called `.m2` in your home directory
2. Create a file called `settings.xml` in the `.m2` folder
3. Copy the following contents to your `~/.m2/settings.xml` making sure to
replace the credentials with the ones you received above:

[source,xml]
----
<settings xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd"
    xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>broadleaf-microservices</id>
      <username>username_here</username>
      <password>password_here</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----

[TIP]
====
More info about authenticating with private repositories can be found
https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers[here] and
https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.3/maven-settings/settings.html[here]

== Building & Running the Project

Now that all of the pre-requisites are installed, let's run the project!

=== Building

Now that all of the pre-requisites are installed, let's build and run the projects!

1. First, we'll need to download or clone this project so that we can run
everything locally on your own machine. You can utilize the `Clone or Download` button at
the top right of this page.
+
2. Once you have the project downloaded, let's go ahead and build it using Maven. You're going to
navigate to the root folder (i.e. the folder that contains the main `pom.xml` file) of where you
downloaded/un-zipped or cloned the project. In the root of this project run the following to build:
+
[source,shell script]
----
mvn clean install
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It may take some time during the initial installation as the process needs to download all required
dependencies. All subsequent builds should go much faster.
====

=== Running
1. Before you start up all the APIs, you'll need to first start up a few supporting services
that are required for this example. These services are provided via docker images and can be run
and started from the command line by navigating to the root of the appropriate project and running:
+
[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose up -d && ./check-tutorial-services-status.sh
----
+
2. Next, you will want to start up the core backend commerce APIs by running the following
command (instead of the simple `mvn spring-boot:run` command) so that you don’t have to
worry about getting a valid JWT authentication token every time:
+
[source,shell script]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -Pnosec
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In this project, we've added a maven profile called `nosec` which
passes in some particular properties to disable certain api security
measures. This allows us to easily demonstrate
some example flows using the Admin and cURL (see Step 3)
====
+
3. That's it! Once you've verified that the supporting services and backend APIs are running, you can visit
the administration console from a browser:
+
- Admin Console: https://localhost:8446
* Username: `master@test.com`
* Password: `Pass1word!`
- cURL Demo:
+
[source,shell script]
----
 curl --insecure -X GET "https://localhost:8447/products?offset=0&forward=true&pageSize=50" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Context-Request: {\"tenantId\":\"5DF1363059675161A85F576D\",\"catalogId\":\"10\"}"
